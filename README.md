# Application:  predicting AD diagnosis, brain volumes, age and biological sex using a multi-branch CNN

Interpreting machine learning methods is a crucial task to increase trust in automatic medical decision making models. In this study, we train a multi-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) to simultaneously detect Alzheimer's disease and predict the age, the biological sex and brain volumes of subjects from 3D T1-weighted brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. We apply the Grad-CAM algorithm to determine the most important regions driving the different predictions. We exhibited common discriminative regions to both age and Alzheimer's disease, as well as strong biomarkers for the biological sex. Volumes and sex predictions were further used as sanity checks to verify the good inner working of the model. We finally put our results in perspective as they are (supposedly) at most as good and reliable as our model performances.
